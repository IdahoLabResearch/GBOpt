# GBOpt
GBOpt is a modular Python tool that uses Monte Carlo–based optimization and structural manipulations to efficiently identify low-energy grain-boundary configurations. It supports multiple atomistic modeling engines and enables rapid exploration of grain-boundary structures in single-element systems.

To install, create a new conda environment
```
conda create --name GBOpt python
conda activate GBOpt
```

Make sure you are in the GBOpt directory:
```
cd ~/projects/GBOpt
```


Then install the dependencies
```
pip install .
```
